Love Always is the debut album of American R&B duo K-Ci & JoJo, released on June 17, 1997, by MCA Records. It was recorded at various studios in New York and the Los Angeles area in 1996 and 1997. It was produced by JoJo and several others, including DeVante Swing, Jon-John Robinson, James Mtume, and Jeff Redd. The duo were originally a part of Jodeci before this album.
The album peaked at number six on the US Billboard 200 and also appeared on international charts. The single "All My Life" charted number one in multiple countries, and all four of the album's singles peaked above the top 25 in the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and the New Zealand Top 40 Singles. Love Always was received favorably by critics, who praised the brothers' singing ability and the production. The album has been certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by Music Canada and IFPI Sweden. It had sold more than 3 million copies in the United States.

Background
Previously, K-Ci & JoJo had been members of the group Jodeci, which consisted of them and another pair of brothers, DeVante Swing and Mr. Dalvin. Under Uptown Records, the group released three studio albums certified platinum by the RIAA: Forever My Lady (1991), Diary of a Mad Band (1993), and The Show, the After Party, the Hotel (1995).
Jodeci has been inactive since 1996. K-Ci & JoJo, seeking to shed Jodeci's "bad boy image", began working on other projects. They appeared as featured artists in songs including Tupac Shakur's "How Do U Want It", which topped the Billboard Hot 100  and E-40's Rapper's Ball, which peaked 29th on the Hot 100. They recorded their first songs as a duo, "If You Think You're Lonely Now" and "How Could You", for the soundtrack albums Jason's Lyric and Bulletproof, respectively. Both singles reached the top 20 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs.

Production, writing, and recording
JoJo told Ebony that he and K-Ci "wrote 75 percent" of Love Always. The brothers said they wanted to make an album that everyone, including their Christian mother, would be able to listen to. K-Ci told Ebony, "We want to write songs that women can listen to. [...] You can listen to this in the car, riding with the folks." Contrasting the album with the brothers' work with Jodeci, K-Ci told Billboard, "With Jodeci, we might sing 'Freek'n You', and with K-Ci & JoJo, we don't use the word 'sex'".
Love Always was the first album K-Ci & JoJo produced. Referring to DeVante Swing, who produced many of Jodeci's songs, K-Ci told Billboard, "We couldn't just say, 'Oh, DeVante's gonna make sure it's mixed right.' We had to do it." Other contributors to the album included Rory Bennett, James Mtume, Jorge Corante, Mike Smoov, Fred Rosser, Jeff Redd, Joey Wlias, Laney Stewart, Gerald Baillergeau, DeVante Swing, Derrick Garrett, Craig Brockman, Victor Merrit, Jon-John Robinson, Andrew Braxton, and Bradley Spalter. Mike Smoov, Jimi Randolph, Derrick Garrett, Thom Cadley, and Mikael Ifverson engineered the album.
Recording took place in 1996 and 1997 at recording studios in New York and the Los Angeles area:

Content
Love Always is written and performed in the R&B and soul styles. It consists of slow jams and love songs. The album's opening track, "HBI", is a short introduction and is followed by "Last Night's Letter", a slow jam about broken hearts. The next song, "Baby Come Back", was written by K-Ci about his past relationship with singer Mary J. Blige. "Love Ballad" is a cover of the L.T.D. song.

The third single, "All My Life", was released on March 17, 1998. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A&M Records. But we listened to it after we got out of the studio and it was like, 'I'm keeping this, this is too hot.'" "All My Life" peaked at number one on the Hot 100 and R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, tying a record set by The Beatles by jumping from 15th to first on the U.S. charts.

The fourth and final single, "Don't Rush (Take Love Slowly)", was originally the B-side to "All My Life"; it was released as a single in July 1998 after it achieved more airplay than "All My Life". It peaked at 24th on the US Rhythmic Top 40, 46th on Hot R&B Airplay, 16th on the UK Singles Chart, 25th on the Dutch Singles Charts, and 26th on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

Critical response
Love Always has received favorable reviews from music critics. Alex Henderson of AllMusic called "Love Ballad" the "best thing the Hailey brothers have ever done – inside or outside of Jodeci".  Henderson called the album's ballads and slow jams "above average" and noted a lack of new jack swing and R-rated lyrics of the sort he had observed in Jodeci's music. He liked the songs "Now and Forever", "Still Waiting", and "Baby Come Back" and appreciated the 1970s soul music feel.
Vibe magazine's Michael Gonzalez gave the album a favorable review, writing, "Love Always is a marvelous musical testament to black love in the '90s." He enjoyed the production, especially from Rory Bennett, and compared the duo to Frankie Lymon. He noticed K-Ci's lyrics in "Baby Come Back" were about his relationship with Mary J. Blige stating "[K-Ci] wails like a man driven crazy by his missteps." Gonzalez also liked the songs "Don't Rush (Take Love Slowly)", and "You Bring Me Up".
