Il Divo (Italian pronunciation: [il ˈdiːvo]; transl. "The Star") are a multinational classical crossover vocal group. Formed in the United Kingdom in 2003, it is a male quartet that was created and then promoted by British media magnate Simon Cowell for Syco Music, a record label that he had administered. The group currently consists of Swiss tenor Urs Bühler, American tenor David Miller, French tenor Sébastien Izambard, and American baritone Steven LaBrie. It previously included Spanish baritone Carlos Marín until his death in 2021 from COVID-19 and later replacement by LaBrie on a permanent basis in 2023.
As of 2021, the group has released ten studio albums: Il Divo (2004), The Christmas Collection (2005), Ancora (2005), Siempre (2006), The Promise (2008), Wicked Game (2011), A Musical Affair (2013), Amor & Pasión (2015), Timeless (2018), and For Once in My Life: A Celebration of Motown (2021); as well as a compilation album, The Greatest Hits (2012). Two other albums – An Evening with Il Divo: Live in Barcelona (2009) and Live in Japan (2014) – presented recordings of live concerts. The group has also collaborated with multiple other musical artists, with Barbra Streisand and Lea Salonga being examples.
Both the group's concerts and its studio releases are known for featuring a variety of languages. Examples include media in French (such as with "Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore"), in Italian (such as with "Nella Fantasia"), and in Spanish (such with "Isabel"), with most of Il Divo's performances involving the Romance languages. The vocalists have additionally attracted notice due to their public image; for instance, they have almost exclusively worn suits by Giorgio Armani during their concerts and other social affairs.
Since its inception, Il Divo has enjoyed significant commercial success, with the group selling over thirty million copies of their albums worldwide as of 2018. An Australian news article has noted that, "[w]hile other copycat" type "bands were formed after Il Divo’s success", "most [of them] have split" and additionally Il Divo stands out due to the vocalists proactive choices in managing their output, such as with the tenor Miller directing the music video for their song "Hola". With 160 certified gold and platinum hits in 35 countries, the group has pioneered the genre of operatic pop, or "popera", in classical crossover music.
Il Divo's live concerts sold over two million concert tickets worldwide just from the group's first four albums. In its first world tour, concerts in 69 cities in 18 countries were sold out.

Members
Il Divo was composed of four singers: former child performer, television and recording artist, and classical baritone Carlos Marin, born in Germany but raised in Spain; two classically trained tenors, Urs Bühler from Switzerland, and David Miller from the USA; and pop singer-songwriter Sébastien Izambard, from France. After Marín's death in late 2021, fellow baritone Steven LaBrie, from the US, joined the band as a special guest on tour before being announced as a full-time member of the group on 17 August 2023.

Conception and name
The idea behind Il Divo came when Simon Cowell, inspired after listening to the Three Tenors, decided to form a multinational quartet of talented young singers to recreate the quality of Luciano Pavarotti, José Carreras, and Placido Domingo. Cowell searched worldwide for young singers who were willing to embark on the project from 21 January 2001, to 16 December 2003, when Miller was signed. Prior to Il Divo, each member enjoyed moderate success individually.

Artistry
Styling
Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by Giorgio Armani (Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni).

Il Divo is a powerful and fascinating presence, in these years have been a great inspiration for me. I remember the first time I saw them performing live: I was impressed by their elegance and their fascinating way to communicate emotions through his music orig.
Il Divo's style is so elegant, it describes our music. It's a dress in the style of the Rat Pack which was composed of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.

Musical style
Il Divo changed the genre of opera with their musical combination of opera singing and classical music, with themes of different genres, including Latin, folk, ballads, church music, bolero and pop.

Multilingual
Il Divo records their songs in several languages: Spanish ("Regresa A Mí", "Hasta Mi Final", "La Vida Sin Amor"), English ("Mama", "Amazing Grace", "Don't Cry For Me Argentina"), Italian ("Senza Parole", "Passerà", "Notte Di Luce"), French ("Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore", "Le Temps des Cathedrales"), Latin ("Panis Angelicus"), Portuguese ("Volta Pra Mim"), and Japanese ("Furusato"). Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song, such as "The Man You Love" (Spanish and English), "Ave Maria" (Italian and Latin), and "I Believe In You" (English & French), whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: "She" (Italian & English) and "Bring Him Home" (English & Spanish).
Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as the group have said that "Spanish is the language of Romanticism".

Other activities
Philanthropy
On 25 April 2007, Il Divo performed on American Idol in one of the "Idol Gives Back" episodes, which raised money for children in the US and Africa.

In 2011, they recorded "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" to raise money for the organisation Save the Children.
