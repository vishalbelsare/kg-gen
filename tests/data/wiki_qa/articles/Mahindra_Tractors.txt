In 1963, the company introduced its first tractor, the Mahindra B-275, as part of a joint venture with International Harvester.

To expand its presence in the U.S. market, Mahindra USA announced a sponsorship in the NASCAR Nationwide Series with R3 Motorsports, which is participating with a #23 Mahindra Tractors Chevrolet.
