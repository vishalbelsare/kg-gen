AT&T Stadium is a retractable roof stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. It serves as the home of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL), and was completed on May 27, 2009.  It is also the home of the Cotton Bowl Classic, the Big 12 Championship Game, and the Southwest Classic. The stadium is one of 11 US venues set to host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The facility, owned by the City of Arlington, has also been used for a variety of other activities, such as concerts, basketball games, soccer, college and high-school football contests, rodeos, motocross, Spartan Races and professional wrestling. It replaced the partially covered Texas Stadium, which served as the Cowboys' home from 1971 through the 2008 season.
The stadium is widely referred to as Jerry World after Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment venue. The stadium seats 80,000 people, but can be reconfigured to hold over 100,000 people by the use of standing room, making it the largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity. Additional attendance is made possible by the Party Pass (open areas) sections behind the seats in each end zone that are positioned on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways.  The record attendance for an NFL regular season game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121. It also has twin video boards that are among the largest high-definition video screens in the world.

Construction and design
Originally estimated at $650 million, the stadium's actual construction cost rose to $1.15 billion, making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built. To aid Cowboys owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5%, the hotel occupancy tax by 2%, and car rental tax by 5%. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding, and Jones covered any cost overruns. The NFL provided the Cowboys with an additional $150 million loan, following its policy for facilitating financing for the construction of new stadiums.
The lead architect on the design team at HKS Architects for the project was Bryan Trubey, who has stated that the overarching concept for the stadium was "...that this should not be just a stadium, but should almost be built like a civic structure."
A pair of nearly 300 ft (91 m)-tall arches spans the length of the stadium dome (one of the tallest domes in the world), anchored to the ground at each end. The new stadium also includes "more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites, concourses, concession areas and more, offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field". It also houses a center-hung Mitsubishi video display board that was the largest HDTV screen in the world at the time of its installation. It has since been surpassed in size by the Panasonic "Big Hoss" video board (218 feet (66 m) wide and 94.6 feet (28.8 m) tall) at Texas Motor Speedway. Glass doors, allowing each end zone to be opened, were designed and constructed by Dallas-based Haley-Greer glass systems.
The retractable roof was designed by structural engineering firm Walter P Moore and the systems were implemented by mechanization consultants Uni-Systems. The electrification of Cowboys Stadium's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.  These kinetic architecture fundamentals  are employed to create quick conversions of the facility to accommodate a variety of events. When the design was officially unveiled on December 12, 2006, it showed that from inside the stadium, the roof (membrane installed by K Post Company of Dallas) will look very similar to the Texas Stadium roof, with its trademark hole. However, it can be covered by the retractable roof panel to protect against the elements.
The football turf field was built by Hellas Construction, which developed a special SoftTop Convertible Turf system that has 26 interchangeable panels to allow the stadium to host a variety of events from concerts, dirt bike races, and monster truck rallies to college football, basketball, and soccer games.

Timeline
1994: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones proposed to expand the 65,000-seat Texas Stadium by up to 40,000 seats, add retractable roof panels and install a climate-control system to make the stadium a year-round venue for sporting events, including the Super Bowl, concerts, and conventions.
1997–2000: The Cowboys held preliminary talks with Arlington officials about building a stadium there. The team also publicly discussed a $260 million plan to upgrade Texas Stadium. In 2000, the Cowboys compiled a list of potential stadium sites, which included Grapevine, Coppell, and Arlington. The team continued negotiating with Irving to renovate Texas Stadium.
2001: Jones said Arlington is a leading contender for a $500 million stadium. The primary site considered is the 2,000 acres (810 ha) Lakes of Arlington tract on Farm to Market Road 157. Other cities in the running included Grapevine and Grand Prairie. In October, Jones discussed the new stadium with the mayors of Arlington, Irving, Grapevine, and Dallas.
2003: The Cowboys asked the Irving City Council to extend their lease at Texas Stadium, which was to expire at the end of the 2008 season, on a year-to-year basis. They narrowed their search to sites in Las Colinas and Dallas, and state legislators filed bills that would allow Dallas County to increase its hotel-occupancy and car-rental taxes to pay for a new stadium.
2004: In April, the Cowboys announced plans to build a $650 million stadium at Fair Park in Dallas. The deal required $425 million in public financing from a 3% hotel-occupancy tax and a 6% car-rental tax. The deal fell apart in June when Dallas County commissioners said they cannot justify asking voters to approve the team's request for $425 million in public funding. In July, the Cowboys and Arlington announced they are negotiating to locate the stadium near Globe Life Park (then Ameriquest Field). In August, the Arlington City Council agreed unanimously to put before voters a tax increase that would fund the city's $325 million portion of the project. Voters approved the tax increase on November 2.
2005: Arlington and the Cowboys chose the site south of Randol Mill Road and east of Collins Street for the new stadium. The city began notifying residents and property owners of its plans to acquire their property. The Cowboys hired the HKS architectural firm to design the stadium. Early blueprints showed 414 luxury suites and a two-panel retractable roof. The city completed its sale of $297.9 million in bonds to pay for its portion of the construction. Demolition of houses began November 1. This included homes that the city had seized from residents who wanted to keep their house and refused to sell. One such resident characterized the negotiation for his home as "...giving me pennies and telling me to get out"
January 2006: The Cowboys hired Oklahoma-based Manhattan Construction as the general contractor for the stadium and the city completed its land purchases, although it still faced a number of lawsuits over land acquisition. Later that month, Tarrant County work crews began demolition of more than 150 Arlington residences and small-business structures to make room for the stadium.
March 2006: An alliance was announced between Manhattan Construction and two general contractors, Rayco Construction of Grand Prairie and 3i Construction of Dallas, to manage the stadium's construction.
April 2006: Excavation began by Mario Sinacola and Sons Excavating. By August, they had moved over 1.4 million cubic yards (1,100,000 m3) of earth, shaping a 13-to-14-acre (5.3 to 5.7 ha) stadium bowl an average of 54 feet (16 m) deep.

Naming
Although the stadium had yet to sell naming rights, many fans started referring to the project with various nicknames such as "Jerry World", the "Death Star", "The Palace in Dallas" (for which announcer Bob Costas was criticized by the Arlington mayor), "Cowboys Cathedral", "Jerrassic Park" and others. There was also a petition by some fans to have the stadium named after longtime Cowboys' coach Tom Landry.
On May 13, 2009, Jerry Jones announced the official name as Cowboys Stadium.
On July 25, 2013, Jerry Jones announced that the Dallas Cowboys had agreed to grant naming rights to AT&T. The name change from Cowboys Stadium to AT&T Stadium took effect immediately. The sponsorship deal was reported to be worth about $17–19 million per year. Facility Solutions Group installed the "AT&T Stadium" letters on the top of the stadium. Signage includes two sets of letters 43 feet (13 m) tall stretching 385 feet (117 m). The letters are made of lightweight components and aluminum and are insulated and heated to melt ice and snow.
This is one of two major sports venues where AT&T holds the naming rights, the other being Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock, Texas.

Video boards
Guinness World Records was on hand at the September 28, 2009, game against the Carolina Panthers to award certificates to the chairman of Mitsubishi Electric and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for the world's largest HD video display. For basketball events played the stadium, such as the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, the 175 feet (58 yd) twin video screens that comprise the length of the scoreboard are actually larger than the court. The video boards have since been surpassed in size, including at several other NFL stadiums, but remain among the largest in the world.

Major events
NBA All-Star Weekend
On February 14, 2010, the stadium hosted the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. With an announced crowd of 108,713, the game became the highest-attended basketball game in history, setting a new Guinness World Record. The East squad prevailed with a 141–139 victory over the West.

NFL
On January 3, 2010, the Cowboys defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in a 24–0 shutout to win the NFC East division title and complete the first ever back-to-back shutouts in franchise history.
On January 9, 2010, the Cowboys hosted the stadium's first playoff game, again playing the Eagles. Dallas won 34–14 in the 2009 NFC Wild Card Game, ending a 13-year playoff win drought.
On February 6, 2011, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XLV, in which the Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31–25. Others bidding for the game's location were the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona and Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Cowboys attempted to increase the stadium's capacity to 105,000 seats in hopes of setting the record for attendance at a Super Bowl. During a last-minute attempt to add seats, seven construction workers were injured by ice sliding off of the stadium roof during an ice storm. Hours before kickoff, over 1,200 seats were blocked off in the interest of safety; according to a police officer in the affected area, the seats had not been finished in time for the fire marshal to inspect them. Approximately 800 people were given other seats inside the stadium, however, about 400 people were unable to be seated. Individuals in the latter group were given free tickets to the next year's Super Bowl and a letter from the NFL that could be exchanged for three times the face value of the Super Bowl XLV ticket. They were also given the option to either watch Super Bowl XLV on a TV in one of the stadium's lounges, where they would be unable to see the field in person, or watch on screens outside the stadium. Over 1,000 displaced fans later joined a lawsuit against the NFL, the Cowboys, and Jerry Jones. The Super Bowl XLV's attendance of 103,219 fell 766 short of the record set in Super Bowl XIV.
In 2018, the stadium hosted the 2018 NFL draft.

AT&T Stadium was the site of the 2009 and 2010 Big 12 Championship Games, the last two held prior to the 2010–13 Big 12 Conference realignment. On December 5, 2009, the Texas Longhorns defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers 13–12 in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the first to be held in the stadium with attendance announced at 76,211. The following year, on December 4, 2010,  the Oklahoma Sooners and Nebraska Cornhuskers rekindled their rivalry as the Sooners won 23–20 in the final Big 12 Championship game until the 2017 season. The stadium was scheduled to host the games through the 2013 season, but the realignment of the Big 12 Conference to 10 teams meant they were not allowed to host a championship game because of NCAA rules requiring conferences to have at least 12 teams divided into two divisions in order to stage a championship game. However, the NCAA would later change its rules and allow a conference championship game regardless of the number of members of said conference.

Cotton Bowl Classic

The win also propelled the Razorbacks to a #5 ranking in the final AP poll and gave them their first 11-win season since joining the Southeastern Conference in 1991. Kansas State ended the season with a 10–3 record and ranked #15 in the final AP poll.

Concessions and merchandising
On October 20, 2008, Cowboys owner Jones and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner announced a joint business venture called Legends Hospitality Management LLC that would operate the concessions and merchandising sales at the new Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas, and at the new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York, along with the stadiums of the Yankees' minor league affiliates. Former Pizza Hut President Michael Rawlings will run the company from its new headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. The company was also backed by Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs and Dallas private equity firm CIC Partners LP.

Art collection
The Jones family commissioned 18 contemporary artists to create site-specific artworks for the stadium. The stadium features paintings, sculptures, and installations by Franz Ackermann, Doug Aitken, Ricci Albenda, Mel Bochner, Daniel Buren, Olafur Eliasson, Teresita Fernandez, Wayne Gonzales, Terry Haggerty, Trenton Doyle Hancock, Jacqueline Humphries, Jim Isermann, Annette Lawrence, Dave Muller, Gary Simmons, and Lawrence Weiner.
In 2013, the stadium acquired Sky Mirror, a sculpture by Anish Kapoor. It sits in a plaza outside the east end of the stadium.

Transportation
Parking
The fees for premium parking at Dallas Cowboys games are estimated at $75 per game, based on season ticket holder parking charges. The fees to park at major concerts and other sporting events will be nearly $40 per space at the new stadium. A shuttle operates between the T&P Station and AT&T Stadium for all Cowboys regular season and postseason games and selected college football games, which averages approximately 900 riders per game.  For special events like Super Bowl XLV parking prices can increase to as much as $990.

Public transit
The stadium was only accessible via the weekday-only Metro Arlington Xpress (MAX) bus system; a 0.4 mi (0.64 km) walk from the Collins and Andrews stop that connected with the Trinity Rail Express (TRE) station at CentrePort/DFW Airport. The bus system was an experimental program operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit that commenced in April 2013 and was replaced by a ride-sharing service in December 2017. Although the replacement service offers connections at CentrePort/DFW Airport station, it does not operate on Sundays.

Criticisms
Video boards
Since its opening, the unorthodox size and positioning of the video boards above the field has been the source of controversy, specifically due to its interference with punts on multiple occasions. During the stadium's first preseason game, on August 21, 2009, a punt by Tennessee Titans punter A. J. Trapasso hit the scoreboard. By rule, the down was replayed. Jerry Jones later remarked that Trapasso was trying to hit the scoreboard, saying, "If you look at how you punt the football, unless you're trying to hit the scoreboard, you punt the ball to get downfield. You certainly want to get some hangtime, but you punt the ball to get downfield, and you sure don't punt the ball down the middle. You punt it off to the side." Whether the screen would affect an opposing team's punting strategy has been debated. For teams with strategies centered on maximizing hang time, physicist Christopher Moore of Longwood University has shown via computer simulation that well-kicked punts have the potential to hit the screen no matter the field position. Trapasso disputed Jones' suggestion that he was intentionally trying to hit the board, and other NFL punters have suggested that the board may pose a problem for longer hang-time punts. The screen was retrofitted with 16 custom winches using 11,000 feet (3,400 m) of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) domestic galvanized wire rope to transport the video board in time to make room for U2's massive set during their 360° Tour, and was moved back down after the concert. The video board is also the primary attachment point for up to 370,000 pounds (170,000 kg) of concert and theatrical rigging.
On August 24, 2013, during a preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Cowboys punter Chris Jones became the second player to hit the scoreboard. He conceded a touchdown on the rekick. Other punters to hit the scoreboard with an in-game kick include Bryan Anger and Jake Camarda.

Sunlight glare
AT&T Stadium's field was constructed on an east–west orientation, and despite being a domed stadium, it features large glass windows behind both end zones. The majority of NFL stadiums are built with the field set in a north–south orientation to avoid sun glare.  For stadium sites which require an east–west layout, teams either use curtains or other obstructions to keep out the sun, or limit large windows to sides of the building where direct sunlight is not an issue.  AT&T Stadium does have curtains, which are used for other events but never closed during Cowboys games. As a result, during Sunday Cowboys games that start in the late afternoon timeslot (typically either 3:05 or 3:25 PM local time), the sunset has created a glare that shines through the stadium's windows behind the west end zone, which have at times interfered with players' vision. Wide receivers have complained about being unable to see the ball being thrown to them due to the glare, and kick/punt returners have complained about being unable to see the ball being kicked towards them.
In a 2024 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb appeared to miss a potential touchdown throw from quarterback Cooper Rush due to the sunlight glare. In a postgame interview, Lamb stated: "I couldn’t see the ball. Couldn’t see the ball, at all. The sun." When asked if he was in favor of using the stadium's existing curtains to block the sunlight (which are used for other non-football events), Lamb responded: "Yes. One thousand percent."
When asked about the sunlight issue, Jerry Jones stated: "We do know where the damn sun's going to be at our own stadium", and when asked about closing the existing curtains during games, Jones rejected the idea, saying, "Well, let's just tear the damn stadium down and build another one? You kidding me?...Everybody's got the same thing...Every team that comes in here has the same issues. They know where the sun's going to be. Every team has the same thing."  Ironically, the Cowboys had to jury-rig a shade for Coach Mike McCarthy's press conference the day after Lamb's comments, as the sun was shining right into his eyes.
