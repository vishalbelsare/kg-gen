High-sticking can refer to two infractions in the sport of ice hockey.
As a non-penalty foul, high-sticking the puck is defined in Rule 80 of the rules of the National Hockey League. It may occur when a player intentionally or inadvertently plays the puck with their stick above the height of the shoulders or above the cross bar of a hockey goal. This can result in a stoppage of play. 
As a penalty, high-sticking is defined in Rule 60 of the rules of the National Hockey League. It may occur when a player hits an opponent's head, face, or neck with their stick in an action judged not to be the result of normal play.

High-sticking the puck (non-penalty foul)
For the purposes of high-sticking the puck, a "high stick" is defined as a stick held above the height of its holder's shoulders. When judging the legality of a goal, a stick is considered a "high stick" if the place where the stick contacted the puck is above the cross bar of a hockey goal.
If a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the team who touched it regains control of the puck, then a stoppage of play results and the next face-off will take place in a disadvantageous position to the offending team. However, if a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the puck is next touched by the opposing team, play is allowed to continue. 
If the puck goes into the opposing net after coming into contact with a high stick, the goal is disallowed. However, if a player knocks the puck into their own net with a high stick, the goal is allowed.

High-sticking (penalty)
For the purposes of a high-sticking penalty, a "high stick" is defined as a stick held above the height of an opponent's shoulders. 
A penalty is assessed if a player strikes an opponent with a high stick as part of an action which is not judged to be "committed as a normal windup or follow through of a shooting motion, or accidental contact on the opposing center who is bent over during the course of a face-off." If no injury results from the play, then high-sticking results in a minor penalty. If the player hit is injured "in the manner of drawing blood or otherwise", then the guilty player can be assessed a double-minor penalty. It is possible for referees to review a high-sticking double minor penalty to confirm that the correct call was made.
If a referee judges that a player has deliberately attempted to injure an opponent by way of high-sticking, then that player can be assessed a match penalty (ejected) for high-sticking. This judgement is made regardless of whether the player was successful in injuring their opponent.
