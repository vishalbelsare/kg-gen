Wilton lies partially in the floodplain of the Cosumnes River. Because some areas of Wilton are in a flood zone, water can be in the streets during the rainy season. In 1997, an El Nino/La Nina year, levees broke and some homes were flooded to the rooftops. On New Years Eve of 2022, parts of Wilton were evacuated due to a flood warning after levee breaches on the Cosumnes River.
