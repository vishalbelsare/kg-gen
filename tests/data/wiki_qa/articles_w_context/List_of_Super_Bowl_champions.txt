The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand, usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums. Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.
Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the "AFL–NFL World Championship Game", but were also casually referred to as "the Super Bowl game" during the television broadcast. Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games. 
A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl. There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. Only two franchises have ever won the Super Bowl while hosting at their home stadiums: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.

Notes
Consecutive wins
Eight franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:

Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls I and II)
Miami Dolphins (VII and VIII)
Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: IX and X; XIII and XIV)
San Francisco 49ers (XXIII and XXIV)
Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII)
Denver Broncos (XXXII and XXXIII)
New England Patriots (XXXVIII and XXXIX)
Kansas City Chiefs (LVII and LVIII)
Although no franchise to date has won three Super Bowls in a row, several have had eras of sustained success, nearly accomplishing a three-peat:

The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL.
The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII) – winning the last two.
The Pittsburgh Steelers won two consecutive Super Bowls (IX and X); the following season they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XI champion Oakland Raiders. They also won two more consecutive Super Bowls (XIII and XIV) for four titles in six seasons.
The San Francisco 49ers won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXIII and XXIV); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXV champion New York Giants.
The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three titles in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles.
The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three titles in five seasons. They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. In the intervening year, they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos.
The Kansas City Chiefs came the closest to a three-peat, winning back-to-back Super Bowls in LVII and LVIII but losing their third consecutive appearance in LIX. They additionally won LIV several years beforehand, and lost LV, for a total of five Super Bowl appearances in six seasons. In the intervening year between LV and LVII, they lost the 2021 AFC Championship Game to the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime, coming one win short of six consecutive appearances. Additionally, in the year prior to their victory in LIV, the Chiefs lost the 2018 AFC Championship Game to the New England Patriots in overtime, resulting in being two wins short of seven consecutive appearances.

Consecutive losses
Three franchises have lost consecutive Super Bowls:

Buffalo Bills (4) (Super Bowls XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII) – The only team to appear in four straight Super Bowls; they lost in all four appearances.
Minnesota Vikings (2) (VIII and IX) – They also lost Super Bowl XI, and were knocked out of the 1975–76 playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl X losers, the Dallas Cowboys, for three losses in four seasons.
Denver Broncos (2) (XXI and XXII) – They also lost Super Bowl XXIV, but did not qualify for the 1988–89 playoffs for Super Bowl XXIII for three losses in four seasons.

Consecutive appearances
The Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins (1971–1973), New England Patriots (2016–2018) and Kansas City Chiefs (2022–2024) are the only other teams to have at least three consecutive appearances. Including those four, 12 teams have at least two consecutive appearances. The Dallas Cowboys are the only team with three separate streaks (1970–1971, 1977–1978, and 1992–1993). The Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Kansas City Chiefs have each had two separate consecutive appearances. The full listing of teams with consecutive appearances is below in order of first occurrence; winning games are in bold:

Green Bay Packers (twice: Super Bowls I and II; XXXI and XXXII)
Dallas Cowboys (thrice: V and VI; XII and XIII; XXVII and XXVIII)
Miami Dolphins (VI, VII, and VIII)

Super Bowl records by franchise
In the sortable table below, franchises are ordered first by number of wins, followed by the total number of appearances, and finally by the total number of points scored for the franchise throughout all appearances. Included in the table are all of the team names that each franchise has had since the 1966 season, a.k.a. the start of the Super Bowl era.

Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories
Eight teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning. In descending order of number of appearances and then years since their last appearance, they are:

Minnesota Vikings (4) – appeared in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI; they won the NFL Championship in 1969, the last year before the AFL–NFL merger, but failed to win the subsequent Super Bowl.
Buffalo Bills (4) – XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII; in 1964 and 1965, they won the last two AFL Championships before the first Super Bowl in 1966.
Cincinnati Bengals (3) – XVI, XXIII, and LVI; an AFL expansion team in 1968, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Carolina Panthers (2) – XXXVIII and 50; a post-merger expansion team, their first season was in 1995.

Teams with no Super Bowl appearances or long active droughts
Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL).  The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season.  Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts (as of the end of the 2024 season):

The Browns are officially viewed as one continuous franchise that began in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference, joined the NFL in 1950, suspended operations after 1995, and resumed play in 1999.
Detroit Lions, 59 years – NFL champions four times in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957; appeared in one other NFL Championship Game in 1954; and  appeared in two NFC Championship Games in the 1991 and 2023 seasons.
