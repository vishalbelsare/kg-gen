A confectionery store or confectionery shop (more commonly referred to as a sweet shop in the United Kingdom, a candy shop or candy store in North America, or a lolly shop in Australia and New Zealand) is a store that sell confectionery, whose intended targeted marketing audiences are children and adolescents. Most confectionery stores are filled with an assortment of sweets far larger than a grocer or convenience store could accommodate. They frequently provide a variety of international sweets and retro delicacies. Very often unchanged in layout since their inception, confectioneries are known for their warming and nostalgic feel, specifically one that brings back childhood memories.

History
Akisato Ritō's Miyako meisho zue (An Illustrated Guide to the Capital) from 1787 describes a confectionery store situated near the Great Buddha erected by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then one of Kyoto's most important tourist attractions.
In 1917, there were 55 confectionery shops in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which had a population of 70,000 people.

Guinness World Records has recognized a store in the village of Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire, England, as being the oldest continuously operating sweet shop in the world. The Oldest Sweet Shop in the World was founded in 1827.
